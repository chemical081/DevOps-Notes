## Learnt Git and Github

## what is Git?
`Git is a version control system that tracks versions of files`
`created by Linus Torvalds in 2005`

## What is Github?
`Github serves as a host for Git repository teams to store their code in a centralized location. Github makes it mnuch easier to use Git`

## Setup Git:
`git config --global user.name <your_name>` github repos username<br>
`git config --global user.email <email>`github repos email<br>
`git config --global core.editor vim`default editor might be vim but just in case it isn't<br>

## Git commands :
`git init`to use the version control we need to instialize it first. We basically are installing git inside the repo or the folder.<br>
`git add . `after we add or make the repo, the first step to save it.<br>
`git commit -m "first commit"`what should i call that step<br>
`git remote add <url>`where should i make the changes. The repos url- this can be found in the repo's Code dropdown menu.<br>
`git push origin main` all is set. Now uploads the added file in the repo.<br>


## Text editor : vim / nano / pico
`There are many text editors that we use. In windows we use notepad but while working with servers we usually use linux and might have access only with the texteditors in Linux. vim is one of those editors.`<br>
`insert mode<i>` when we get inside vim, we need to get into insert mode to be able to type stuffs that might be code, texts or scripts.<br>
`command mode<esc :>`to get out of insert mode we press Esc and to get out of vim type `:q`<br>
